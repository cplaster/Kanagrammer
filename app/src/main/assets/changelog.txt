Implemented a different processing engine. SortedWordDictionary deserializes the main dictionary and prunes it based on queries and minimum
word length. AnagramSolver is an instance class that encapsulates SortedWordDictionary and provides various methods which manipulate SortedWordDictionary.
AnagramSolverHelper is a static class that provides utility methods used by AnagramSolver.

Currently, the engine allows for searching for Exact anagrams, Exact subsets (scrabble usage) and sorting both alphabetically and by score, and a Multiword search
which is also optionally limited by minimum word length.

Moving forward, the Multiword search should also optionally implement a filter for the exact amount of words desired, and also optionally the lengths of each
of those respective desired words. To begin with, these filters can be applied upon the base Multiword search results, however optimally this may be better
applied during the base Multiword method itself for speed reasons.

Also, all search functions should ideally happen on a thread separate from the UI, in order to provide progress feedback. The Multiword method in particular can
take a significant amount of time to complete, so some UI feedback really is necessary.
